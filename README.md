# methylation_scaling
Code to reproduce results as presented in the manuscript "DNA methylation rates scale with maximum lifespan across mammals". 

Unless otherwise stated, all methylation datasets and metadata referred to can be downloaded directly from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) in
pre-processed form, usually via the "series matrix" file. These are then saved in the "data" folder.

Please send any issues/requests to Sam Crofts (sam.crofts@ed.ac.uk)
